    <p>Like animals, the Toronto Zoo houses a variety of plant species from around the world! But, did you know the Toronto Zoo is home to one of the largest tropical plant collections in Canada? You can see many of these plants year-round as you enter the pavilions, in our Greenhouse or around site during the warmer months. The Toronto Zoo has a whole horticulture team full of plant experts to ensure they are taken care of, especially since Canada has a much different climate than many of the areas the plants come from.
        Bio-Geographical Plant Sourcing and Displays:  Plants and seeds are sourced internationally by the Curatorial Gardener; from private collectors, and nurseries around the world.  Seeds are sourced from Africa for our African Rainforest Pavilion, Australia for our Australasia Pavilion, etc.  Some plants are grown for years in the Greenhouse before they are ready to be added to displays and habitats onsite!
        Landscape Development: Creating and renovating gardens, animal habitats and picnic areas are ongoing projects for the Horticulture team. Some of the projects onsite include; Shamba Farms, Browse Plantations, Ornamental Garden Displays, and animal habitats both inside, and outside. Creating, renovating, and rejuvenating existing horticultural features is something the team loves to do! Along with all of these, the team takes care of the Natural Play, Native Art Garden, Core Woods revitalization, and invasive species identification and control. </p>
